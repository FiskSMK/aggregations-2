It can modify the record in the database, however, when I finished the update and redirect to the action which shows the <strong>course</strong> information. The page will cache the <strong>course information</strong> before update. </p>  <p>Say I edited the duration from 3 to 30 . And redirect to the information page, the duration will be 3  , when I refresh , and duration will be 3 again. But when I refresh once again, the duration will be 30. <strong>3->3->30->3->3->30</strong> and so on.

I need bins to be equally spaced in log10. Using a logarithmic scale on the y axis isn't a problem. The main problem is creating the bin on the x axis. For example, using 10 bins in log10, first bins will be [1],[2],[3]....[10 - 19][20 - 29].....[100 190] and so on. I've searched on the net but I couldn't find any practical solution. If realizing it in gnuplot is too much complicated  could you suggest some other software/language to do it?</p>  <p>As someone asked I will explain more specifically what I need to do. I have a (huge) list like this:</p>  <pre><code>1   14000000 2   7000000 3   6500000 . . . . 6600    1 8900    1 15000   1 19000   1 </code></pre>  <p>It shows, for example, that 14 milions of ip addresses have sent 1 packet, 7 milions 2 packets.... 1 ip address have sent 6600 packets, ... , 1 ip address have sent 19000 packets.

The result is understandable but not too appropriate. In fact, the boxes became more and more thin going right on the x axis because, obviously, there are more points in 10-100 than in 1-10!

For some reason, the page that renders on localhost is much smaller than if I were to simply render the html directly in the browser. For example, I have a div that spans 100% of the screen when rendered normally, but through Express &amp; Nodejs, the div renders at about 90% of the screen, and centered. It's also offset from the top, which I had not intended.</p>  <p>Anybody have any idea how to fix that? It's as if express is putting a large div-wrapper around all of my content and restricting the height/width.</p> ", "tags" : [ "css", "node.js", "express", "jade" ], "rnd" : 0.5000048100482672 }
